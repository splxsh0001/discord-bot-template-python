### Using Features

#### Reaction Role Management

1. In your server, create a message that you want to use for reaction roles.
2. Configure the `reaction_roles` dictionary in your bot's code with emoji-role ID pairs.
3. When users react to the message with the specified emoji, they'll receive the associated role.

#### Giveaway Hosting

1. Use the `?giveaway` command to start a giveaway. Provide the giveaway duration in seconds, the prize description, and the number of winners.
2. The bot will create a giveaway message and react to it with ðŸŽ‰.
3. Users can react to the giveaway message to enter the giveaway.
4. After the giveaway duration ends, the bot will randomly select winners and announce them.

#### Poll Creation

1. Use the `?poll` command to create a poll. Provide the poll title and options separated by commas.
2. The bot will create a poll message with reaction options.
3. Users can react to the poll message with their choice.

#### Custom Commands

1. Use the `?commands` command to list available commands.
2. Use other commands such as `?hello`, `?kick`, `?av`, `?server_info`, and `?ping` to interact with the bot's features.

#### Bot Status and Presence

1. The bot will have a custom presence that says "Watching over splxsh's server".
2. Clicking on the bot's status message will open your specified YouTube channel in the user's web browser.
