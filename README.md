4. After the giveaway duration ends, the bot will randomly select winners and announce them.

#### Poll Creation

1. Use the `?poll` command to create a poll. Provide the poll title and options separated by commas.
2. The bot will create a poll message with reaction options.
3. Users can react to the poll message with their choice.

#### Custom Commands

2. Use other commands such as `?hello`, `?kick`, `?av`, `?server_info`, and `?ping` to interact with the bot's features.
